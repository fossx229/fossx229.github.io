	<li> A unique semester-long course where we built a completed mood tracking web-app. The web-app was completed using a modified MEAN stack and an Agile workflow. I worked in teams of 4-8 people for four two-week long iterations. The project concluded with 875 commits, 10,000 lines of code, and contributions from 23 people.</li>
	<li>Created a neural network to classify email as being spam or not spam. The project was designed using Google Colab with tensorflow.</li>
	<li>Created a simple point of sales system for a theoretical movie theater using node JS, angular JS, and MySQL. Employees were able to log in and process transactions. All transactions, prices, and items were saved on the back end. </li>
	<li>The sorting is a multi-lab exercise on developing the fastest sorting algorithm for a data-type. Data for this sorting competition consists of positive numbers of 17 decimal digits or less, passed to the sorting method as an array of strings. The data was sorted by the product of the two smallest prime factors of a number. My team placed 7th overall out of 14 teams.</li>
	<li>Created a Shiny App using R-studio with storm damage data from NOAA.gov. Building the app involved data clean-up and statistical analysis. Users were able to view the data with leaflet. I had to clean up the data and analyze it to see general trends associated with different kinds of storms. The app uses leaflet which allows users to view storm damage through a map. Users are able to filter by date, storm type, and view statistics associated with it.</li>
